# Setup

## 1. Download and install python 3.11.x on your laptop. 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

It is a good practice to always use the lastest version with supports: 
https://endoflife.date/python

##  2. Download PyCharm Pro 
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Pycharm is free for students.
Activate license with your student email address.

##  3. Create a github repository named MLOpsPython on your own github account.
##  4. Clone your own repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPOSITORY/MLOpsPython
cd MLOpsPython
# Exclude Pycharm local files from git
echo '.idea' > .gitignore 
```

## 5. Installation of pipenv

https://pipenv.pypa.io/

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --python 3.11.1
```

## 6. Configure Pipenv with PyCharm Python Interpreter

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pipenv.html

## 7. Check code quality with Flake8 

https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/

```bash
echo 'print("hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world hellor world")
from pathlib import Path
package_dir = Path(__file__).parent.absolute()
print(package_dir)' > demo_flake8.py
```

```bash
pipenv install flake8===6.0.0 --dev
pipenv run flake8
```

You can configure rules using a setup.cfg file
```bash
echo '[flake8]
max-line-length = 122' > setup.cfg
```

Now you can re-run Flake8
```bash
pipenv run flake8
```

## 8. Fix and reformat code with Black

https://black.readthedocs.io

```bash
pipenv install black===23.1.0 --dev
pipenv run black demo_flake8.py
```

You can configure black8 using a pyproject.toml file
```bash
echo '[tool.black]
max-complexity = 10
line-length = 122' > pyproject.toml
```
Now you can re-run black
```bash
pipenv run black
```

## 9. Continuous Integration with Github Action

Now you can commit then push your code on github.
```bash
git add . 
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

We create our first github action to check code quality with Flake8 and Black.
```bash
mkdir .github
cd .github
mkdir workflows
cd workflows
echo '
name: Python Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install --user pipenv
    - name: Format with Black
      run: |
        pipenv install --dev
        pipenv run black .
        pipenv run black . --check
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        pipenv install --dev
        pipenv run flake8 .
' > python-ci.yml
```

Now we can protect your "main" branch on github. Add a security constrain, that your code must pass the CI before merging.

```bash
git checkout -b test-pullrequest
# modify your code to make your test fail
git add .
git commit -m "Test pull request"
git push
```

Now you can create a pull request on github. You can see that your CI is running. You can see now your main branch is protected. You main code must be always in deliverable in production.
